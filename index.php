		<h2>About Me</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		My name is Jesse Prescott, and I am a .NET Software Developer, currently living in Augusta, GA. My wife is in the Marine Corps, which is what brought us here (Fort Gordon).<br/>
		<br/>
		I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the end of 2016 (a 14 year journey of on and off part-time course work). I never imagined I would continue on after that, as I've never viewed a master's degree necessary for a programmer, but once I heard about Harvard Extention School, I thought about how cool it would be to have a Harvard degree!<br/>
		<br/>
		I am very excited for 2017, as it is the start of this adventure, as well as a becoming a father in April!
